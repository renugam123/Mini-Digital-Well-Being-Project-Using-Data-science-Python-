WildGuard AI is an AI-powered multi-sensor system that prevents wildlife–train collisions in forest railway corridors. It detects animal movement using thermal, seismic, and acoustic sensors, calculates a Collision Risk Index, and sends real-time alerts and speed advisories to protect biodiversity and ensure safer rail operations.
